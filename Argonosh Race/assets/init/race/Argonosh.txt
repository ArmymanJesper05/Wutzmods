The Argonosh are a very ancient race. The have been dwelling the depths of the Sian Mountains since the old time. Normally they live in a hivemind society with a queen which both breeds their spawn 
and also is their common "sense". Although a hivemind in their agelong existence some Argonosh hives seem to have developed some kind of individuality for their insects and are also progressing in fields of
technology, tool making and even clothes! However once the queen of a hive dies, without having spawned a new one before, the hive collapses and the whole population either dies or wander out, becoming wild Argonosh. 
It is said that all Argonosh once formed a giant, world spanning hive which was controlled by their great Queen, Empress Shmalor. Empress Shmalor was said to be one of the hugest and strongest beings in the old time
and legends say she is still crawling and hunting somewhere deep below the Sian Mountains. Always hungry, always looking for her hive.
