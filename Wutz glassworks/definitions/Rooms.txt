All rooms need to be constructed. Rooms must usually be placed indoors, meaning under a roof, 
with a few exception such as farms.
%r%%r%
As you place the rooms, you'll see how much materials will be used in the construction process 
and also a few pointers concerning the shape and layout of the room. Try to max out these stats.
%r%%r%
Other aspects to consider is of course logistics. Try to place rooms close to the production of 
the resource they are about to consume. Also, try to place service rooms a bit away from noisy
industries and the like.
%r%%r%
Walls are also to be taken into account. Rooms with items can often place these items along walls, 
meaning you can fit more stuff into them. Walls can also prevent your rooms from becoming 
traffic jams. Furthermore, walls increase coziness and prevent sound from travelling. 
%r%%r%
Once you've finished placing a room, subjects will begin constructing it. 
First they must gather the resources needed, provided they are available either in your stockpiles,  
or scattered somewhere on the map. Then they will start building the ground work, 
finally moving on to the items themselves if such have been placed.

Farms is where subjects turn soil, water, sunlight and time into useful resources, suchs as crops or cotton.
The work process is governed by the four seasons: 
%r%%r%
Spring - Clearing weeds%r%
Summer - Tending to the crops%r%
Autumn - Harvesting%r%
Winter - Resting
%r%%r%
This means a farmer isn't very busy Spring and Winter and available for other chores.
%r%%r%
Farms are best placed at ground with high fertility. You can see the fertility by holding the right mouse button 
on the map. If a farm gets all the work it needs, the farmer's work skill and tool level can double the yeild. Technologies and bonuses can further increase this.
Rain also determines yeild. A 8x8 farm with 30% fertility produces at minumum food for a little more than 1 person. A maxed out farm of the same size can produce for 8 people.
boosted, 100% fertile farm will produce food for 8 induviduals.
